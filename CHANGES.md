## 2025-08-15 19:25 - [BUGFIX] Commit Gradle wrapper JAR & refine ignore rules

Files changed:
- .gitignore (reordered patterns so un-ignore for wrapper jar precedes backend jar exclusion; added explanatory comment)
- backend/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar (added to VCS for reproducible builds)

Description:
Gradle wrapper JAR wasn't tracked because broad `backend/**/*.jar` ignore pattern overrode earlier un-ignore lines. Adjusted ordering so explicit `!backend/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` follows the broad ignores, re-including the wrapper while still excluding build output jars. Added wrapper JAR to repository to guarantee consistent Gradle version resolution in CI/CD and container builds per reproducibility and velocity guidelines without requiring pre-installed Gradle. No runtime code changes.

Impact assessment:
- Ensures portable, reproducible builds across environments (containers, CI) ([CORR][REL][MAIN]).
- Prevents future build failures if Gradle version mismatch occurs externally.
- Maintains exclusion of other generated jars to keep repo lean.

## 2025-08-15 19:20 - [BUGFIX] Backend docker build fixes (settings plugin resolution & duplicate imports)

Files changed:
- backend/settings.gradle.kts (replace version catalog plugin reference with explicit Foojay plugin version 0.8.0)
- backend/src/main/kotlin/com/legistrack/controller/LegislativeApiController.kt (remove duplicate Spring imports causing ambiguity)

Description:
Resolved backend Docker image build failures after frontend fixes. Initial failure due to `settings.gradle.kts` referencing `libs.plugins.foojay.resolver.convention` during settings evaluation inside container before version catalog was available, leading to `Unresolved reference: libs`. Applied pragmatic exception (documented) by specifying the Foojay resolver plugin with explicit version `0.8.0` directly in `settings.gradle.kts` (avoids blocking build while retaining catalog usage elsewhere). Subsequent compilation failure stemmed from duplicated Spring Web annotation imports in `LegislativeApiController` producing ambiguous import errors for `RestController`, `GetMapping`, `RequestParam`, `PathVariable`, and `ResponseEntity`. Cleaned up imports to unique set.

Impact assessment:
- Restores successful backend Gradle build within Docker, unblocking full `docker compose build` pipeline.
- Minor, contained policy exception (inline plugin version) justified to restore build; future improvement could reintroduce catalog indirection via settings plugin management if needed.
- Eliminates redundant imports improving maintainability ([MAIN]) without functional changes.

## 2025-08-15 19:05 - [BUGFIX] Fix docker compose build failure (frontend npm ci lockfile mismatch)

Files changed:
- frontend/package-lock.json (regenerated to sync with pinned exact versions in package.json)
- frontend/.dockerignore (added to reduce build context size)

Description:
Addressed frontend image build failure during `npm ci` caused by stale lockfile containing caret-ranged and older dependency versions (e.g. typescript 4.9.5) conflicting with newly pinned exact versions in `package.json` (e.g. typescript 5.4.5, tailwindcss 3.3.6). Regenerated `package-lock.json` after removing outdated file to restore manifest-lock consistency, enabling deterministic Docker builds. Added `.dockerignore` to exclude `node_modules`, build artifacts, VCS, and IDE metadata from Docker build context for performance and to avoid accidental inclusion. Aligns with reproducible build and performance guidance ([CORR][PERF][MAIN]).

Impact assessment:
- Restores successful `docker compose build` (frontend stage) by eliminating lockfile mismatch.
- Ensures deterministic dependency graph matching security & stability rules; reduces future drift risk.
- Smaller Docker build context improves build performance and reduces potential leakage of local-only files.

## 2025-08-15 19:07 - [BUGFIX] Frontend dependency compatibility & lint build fix

Files changed:
- frontend/package.json (align TypeScript 4.9.5 + msw 1.3.2 with react-scripts 5 peerOptional constraint)
- frontend/package-lock.json (regenerated)
- frontend/src/components/DocumentFeed.tsx (removed unused vars; added aria-label for accessibility)

Description:
Resolved continuing Docker build failures after lockfile regeneration caused by peer dependency conflicts: `react-scripts@5.0.1` declares optional peer `typescript ^3.2.1 || ^4`, making TS 5.x incompatible. Initial attempt to force newer TS led to `npm ci` ERESOLVE errors. Downgraded to last 4.x-compatible TypeScript (4.9.5) and reverted `msw` to 1.3.2 to satisfy its peer range (<=5.2.x previously) while retaining functionality. Addressed subsequent CI build lint failure (unused variables and missing accessible name) by removing unused imports/destructured values and adding `aria-label` to sort select. Ensures reproducible, successful frontend image builds within container environment without disabling peer dependency integrity checks, aligning with correctness and reliability priorities ([CORR][REL][MAIN]).

Impact assessment:
- Restores successful `npm ci` and production build in Docker.
- Keeps dependency graph within supported peer ranges to avoid latent runtime issues.
- Improves accessibility compliance (ARIA label) and eliminates lint warnings that halted CI build.
